# IoTSummerCourse

This is my repository for the work I've done in the summer course "Applied IoT at Linnaeus University" (1DT305).

The code is in the *micropython* directory and the source for the report is in the *report* directory.

The report can also be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@mpetter/HyrfZ0TCu)
